"""Property test for Luna platform-spoof navigation invariance (task 5.6).

Feature: amazon-luna-streaming, Property 2: Navigation invariance

**Property 2:** For any sequence of navigations within a Luna browser
session (detail page -> player -> any further Luna page), the platform value
reported by ``navigator.userAgentData.getHighEntropyValues()`` equals the
configured Windows value at every step, including on the first page before
any navigation. (This is the invariant whose violation at page-level-only
scope was the observed real failure mode F3.)

**Validates: Requirements 14.4, 14.10, 14.11**

The design note allows Property 2 to use a local harness page driven by a
real headless browser; here it is kept as a **mock-CDP unit test** (no real
browser, no Amazon) so it runs in CI without a GPU/display. The mock
``_NavigatingBrowser`` stands in for the browser-level ``BrowserCdpSession``:
every navigation / reload / new-document load spawns a *fresh* CDP target
that enters ``waitForDebuggerOnStart``, and the mock reports the spoofed
Windows platform for a page **only if** the per-new-document override script
(``Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument``) was installed on that target
*before* it was released via ``Runtime.runIfWaitingForDebugger``. A
page-level-only override that failed to re-apply on navigation would read
back ``"Linux"`` here (reproducing F3). Driving the real
``LunaPlatformSpoofer.run_attach`` (browser-level ``Target.setAutoAttach``)
against this mock and then ``run_verify`` after each navigation asserts the
override persists across the whole session.
