"""Property test for Luna platform-spoof target coverage (task 5.4).

Feature: amazon-luna-streaming, Property 1: Spoof target coverage

**Property 1:** For any set of browser targets attached during a Luna session —
regardless of count, type (page or service worker), or whether the target
existed at attach time or was created afterward — the ``LunaPlatformSpoofer``
applies the full platform override (UA string, UA Client Hints metadata with
platform=Windows, ``navigator.platform``, WebGL renderer) to that target
**before** the target is resumed from its waiting-for-debugger state.

**Validates: Requirements 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7**

The auto-attach loop (``LunaPlatformSpoofer.run_attach``) is driven against a
*mock CDP layer* (``_MockBrowserCdpSession``) standing in for the browser-level
``BrowserCdpSession`` — no real browser and no Amazon. The mock emits a
Hypothesis-generated set of targets of varying count, type, and *creation
order*: some exist at attach time, others appear only after the browser-level
``Target.setAutoAttach`` has been sent (modelling CDP auto-attach of
later-created targets). Every command the spoofer sends is recorded per
``sessionId`` with its order, so the test can assert, for *every* target, that
the full override landed and that the resume (``Runtime.runIfWaitingForDebugger``)
came strictly last — i.e. no target is ever left unspoofed.

≥100 iterations (Hypothesis ``max_examples=200``).
