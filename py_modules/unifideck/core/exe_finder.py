"""core/exe_finder.py — Game executable locator.
Searches install directories and Wine prefixes for the main .exe file.
Replaces duplicated exe detection logic across Epic, GOG, Amazon, and
Ubisoft stores.
Strategy:
1. Walk the install directory tree (max depth 3)
2. Filter out known wrappers/launchers/redistributables
3. Score candidates by: hint match > shallow depth > larger file size
4. Return the highest-scoring candidate
