"""core/sync_service.py — Generic library synchronization orchestrator.
Replaces the legacy 623-line `Plugin.sync_libraries()` monolith in
main.py which contained 5 hardcoded branches (one per store), 5 null
checks, 5 install-status loops and 5 games_map updates — adding a
6th store required duplicating code in every phase.
In the new architecture:
1. SyncService iterates `StoreRegistry.all()` — zero hardcoded branches
2. Each store is fetched via polymorphic `store.get_library()` call
3. Results are merged into a dict keyed by store name
4. SYNC_PROGRESS is emitted per store so the frontend can update a
 progress bar without knowing which stores are registered
5. SYNC_COMPLETE is emitted once with the full merged result
6. Errors are isolated per store: one failing store does not block
 the others; a STORE_ERROR event is emitted with the typed error
Concurrency model:
- A single `asyncio.Lock` prevents concurrent sync runs (the legacy
 behaviour: trying to start a sync while one is already running
 returns an error immediately)
- Cancellation is supported via an `asyncio.Event` that handlers check
 between stores; `cancel()` sets it and returns immediately
- Metadata and artwork services subscribe to SYNC_COMPLETE and run in
 parallel after sync finishes (via EventBus fan-out)

5.5 (sync flow comparison), Figure 52/53.
