"""core/metrics_collector.py — In-memory metrics aggregator.

Moved from services/ to core/. metrics_collector is
a plugin-level observer that subscribes to every EventBus event
and maintains a global snapshot for the diagnostics panel. It is
NOT a store-interaction service in the Layer-5 sense — it provides
no functionality to any store and has no store-specific logic.
Its character matches the other cross-cutting primitives at
core/ root (cache_manager, sync_service): initialized once at
plugin boot, lives for the process lifetime, touches no store
directly. Clean break: no shim in services/.

Subscribes to every EventBus event and maintains counters, timers,
and gauges in memory. Exposes the current snapshot via
`get_plugin_metrics()` which is called by the frontend to display
a diagnostics panel.
Metric types:
- counter : monotonically increasing integer
- timer : duration between paired events (e.g. SYNC_STARTED →
 SYNC_COMPLETE) in milliseconds
- gauge : latest value from an event payload
The catalog of 21 metrics defined in the technical document is
derived directly from the EventBus events — no manual counter
increments needed anywhere else in the codebase.
Reference: Technical Document v1.0 — Section 9.6, Figure 83.
