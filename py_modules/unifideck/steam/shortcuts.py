"""steam/shortcuts.py — Steam shortcuts.vdf I/O utilities.
Moved from shortcuts/vdf.py and renamed. The old
location was a solo-file subpackage whose identity was unclear
(was it "all shortcut management" or "just VDF codec"?). The
new home makes the answer explicit: this is **Steam's**
shortcuts file format, handled alongside the other Steam-client
interactions (library scan, SteamGridDB artwork). The former
filename `vdf.py` was also misleading — this module is NOT a
generic VDF codec; all 4 public functions are hardcoded to the
shortcuts.vdf layout (load_shortcuts_vdf, read_shortcuts,
save_shortcuts_vdf, write_shortcuts).
Thin wrapper around the external `vdf` library with safer
I/O semantics:
- Atomic write-then-rename so Steam never reads a half-written
  file
- Automatic `.backup` before overwriting (for rollback)
- Write validation: re-parse the file after writing and compare
  shortcut counts; restore the backup if validation fails
- Structured logging instead of `print` statements
- Functions are synchronous — callers should wrap them in
  `asyncio.to_thread()` (done by ShortcutService via AsyncFileOps)
The legacy module used `print()` for errors and didn't do atomic
writes, which created a small window where `shortcuts.vdf` could
be read by Steam mid-write and corrupt the library. This version
eliminates that race condition.

format), Figure 23.
