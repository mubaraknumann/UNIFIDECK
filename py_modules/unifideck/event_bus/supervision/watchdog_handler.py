"""event_bus/supervision/watchdog_handler.py — Timeout + quarantine for EventBus handlers.

This module provides:

  1. `HandlerWatchdog.invoke(handler, *args, **kwargs)` — a wrapper
     that runs a handler with `asyncio.wait_for()` and a per-handler
     timeout. On timeout, it raises `asyncio.TimeoutError` up to
     the caller (which logs and continues with the next event).

  2. A `consecutive_timeouts` counter per handler. When a handler
     accumulates N consecutive timeouts (default 10), it is marked
     as `quarantined` — future invocations return immediately
     without calling the handler. A log ERROR is emitted on
     quarantine entry, and an RPC `release_quarantine(handler)`
     lets operators un-quarantine it after a fix.

  3. A `HandlerTimeoutMetrics` dataclass exposed via
     `get_metrics()` for integration into `get_bus_health()`.

Design principles:
  - **Occasional timeouts are normal**. A single slow network call
    is not a reason to ban a handler. Quarantine only triggers on
    N *consecutive* failures — one successful invocation resets
    the counter to 0.
  - **No data loss on quarantine**. The event that tripped the
    quarantine is still dispatched to the other (healthy) handlers.
    Only the broken handler is bypassed.
  - **No silent failures**. Every timeout logs WARNING. Quarantine
    entry logs ERROR. Release logs INFO.
  - **Thread-safety not required**. Runs on the single asyncio
    loop like the rest of the dispatcher — no locks needed.
