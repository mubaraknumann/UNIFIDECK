"""
UPC game uninstall pipeline — removes a game cleanly from the prefix.

OP-56g | py_modules/unifideck/stores/ubisoft/installer/uninstall.py

``UbisoftUninstaller`` removes an installed Ubisoft game from disk and
from every state-tracking layer:

* the game's install directory (recursive remove);
* the entry in the installer registry;
* the entry in the id_map;
* the Steam shortcut (delegated to the shortcut service);
* the SteamGridDB artwork cache.

Operates idempotently: if any one of the layers has already been
removed, the corresponding cleanup is a no-op rather than a failure.
This is important because Unifideck can be re-installed and re-detect
half-removed state from a previous uninstall.
