"""
Steam cross-reference filter — hide Ubisoft games already in the Steam library.

OP-55i | py_modules/unifideck/stores/ubisoft/steam_filter.py

When the user owns the same game on both Steam and Ubisoft Connect
(common with Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six titles), we don't
want to display it twice in the unified library — the Steam version
should win because launching it through Steam is more reliable than
through the UPC overlay.

This module exposes pure functions that, given the user's Steam library
and the Ubisoft owned-games list, return the filtered Ubisoft list with
known-Steam games removed. Filtering is controlled by
``UbisoftConfig.filter_steam_linked`` (on by default) and the optional
``steam_library_cross_ref`` toggle (off by default; enables fuzzy
cross-matching by name when the SteamGridDB id isn't available).
