        This is Luna's half of the Req 9 prerequisite flow. When
        :meth:`is_available` reported ``needs_browser`` (no supported browser,
        Req 9.1), the frontend offers the install and calls this to run it.
        The install itself reuses the shared flatpak installer unchanged
        (``EdgeBrowser.install`` → ``edge_browser/installer.py``) — Luna adds
        only the two things it specifically needs on top: its own
        narrowly-scoped profile-dir override plus ``/run/udev:ro`` after a
        successful install, and resuming the operation the missing browser
        interrupted.

        Outcomes (design error table, Req 9.4–9.6):

        * **flatpak absent** → ``Result(success=False, error=flatpak_not_found)``.
          Nothing is attempted; the pre-install state is untouched (Req 9.6).
        * **install failure or >600s** → ``Result(success=False,
          error=installation_failed)`` carrying the installer's reason in
          ``metadata["reason"]``; the interrupted operation is left in its
          pre-install state so the user can retry (Req 9.5). The reused
          installer makes no partial changes on failure, so "pre-install
          state kept" needs no extra rollback here.
        * **success within 600s** → the Luna profile-dir + ``/run/udev:ro``
          flatpak overrides are applied (Req 9.4), then — if a ``resume``
          callable was handed in — the interrupted Luna operation is run and
          its result is surfaced, so the user does not have to restart it
          manually. ``metadata["resumed"]`` records whether a resume ran.

        Args:
          resume: Optional zero-arg coroutine factory for the operation the
            missing browser interrupted (e.g. ``self.start_auth`` or
            ``self.get_library``). Run only after a successful install and
            after the overrides are applied. When omitted, a bare success is
            returned so a caller that only needs the browser present can use
            this without a follow-up.

        Returns:
          A :class:`Result`; on a resumed success its ``metadata`` also
          carries the resumed operation's own metadata (so the panel still
          sees the resulting :class:`LunaStatus`).
