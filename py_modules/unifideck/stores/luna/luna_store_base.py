"""Shared-state declarations for the Luna store method mixins.

The former single ``luna_store.py`` was one class; its methods are now split
across focused sibling mixins (``luna_store_library_sync``,
``luna_store_recovery``, ``luna_store_install``) that
:class:`~unifideck.stores.luna.luna_store.LunaStore` combines. Each mixin
reaches ``self._*`` attributes and sibling-mixin methods that only exist on the
composed class. :class:`_LunaStoreState` declares those attributes and
cross-mixin method signatures as annotations only — no runtime behaviour — so
each mixin type-checks in isolation under strict mypy, exactly as the
``rpc/mixins`` packages declare their shared ``registry``/``services`` handles.
The real values are assigned by ``LunaStore.__init__`` and the real methods are
provided by the sibling mixins.
