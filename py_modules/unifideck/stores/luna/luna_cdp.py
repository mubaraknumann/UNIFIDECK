"""Shared Luna CDP helpers (one owner for the page-target-attach step).

The browse-page catalog scrape (:mod:`luna_catalog`), the detail-page play
trigger (:mod:`luna_play_activator`) and the platform-probe verify
(:mod:`luna_platform_spoofer`) all begin the same way: ask the browser for its
targets, find the first ``page`` target, and attach to it in flatten mode to
get a CDP session id. The three bodies were byte-for-byte the same CDP calls in
the same order, differing only in the exception each raises on failure — which
is exactly the body-shape duplication ``validate_architecture.py`` check 13
flags.

Promoted here (SHARED_HELPERS row ``attach_to_page_target``) so there is one
definition. Each caller keeps its own failure semantics by passing a
``raise_no_target`` / ``raise_no_session`` factory that builds the module's own
exception with the message that caller already surfaced.
