"""security/ephemeral_creds.py — Ephemeral plaintext exposure for CLIs.

Generic primitive that lets a third-party CLI (legendary, nile,
gogdl, …) read its credentials from disk **only for the duration
of one invocation**. Outside that window the plaintext never
exists on the filesystem; only a UFD1-encrypted copy at our
chosen path remains, protected by the same machine-id-derived
key used by every other token in Unifideck.

Threat model
------------
Closes the gap between Unifideck (which encrypts everything it
owns) and the CLIs we shell out to (which historically write
plaintext credentials in ``~/.config/<cli>/``). After integration:

  - The plaintext file exists for tens of milliseconds at most,
    inside a process-private 0o700 tempdir under ``/tmp``.
  - The persistent storage at our canonical path is UFD1-
    encrypted, machine-bound, and protected by ``secure_io``
    against symlink redirection at read time.
  - A CLI that rotates its refresh token mid-call writes the
    new value into the tempdir; the context manager reads it
    back on exit and re-encrypts before any cleanup, so token
    rotation survives across invocations.
  - On any failure (CLI crash, async cancellation, exception in
    the caller), the tempdir is wiped in ``__aexit__`` so no
    plaintext leaks past the context boundary.

Threat model NOT addressed
--------------------------

  - A local attacker watching ``/tmp`` while the CLI runs can
    snapshot the plaintext during the exposure window. We rely
    on tempdir 0o700 perms + the short window to make this
    impractical, but it is fundamentally a tradeoff: a CLI
    needs to read its credentials at some point, and on a
    Linux system that means writing them somewhere readable.
  - A CLI that resists ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` overrides and
    insists on ``$HOME/.config/<cli>/`` cannot be ephemeral-
    wrapped without symlinking at that path, which is a
    different (and worse) security posture. Such CLIs need a
    PR upstream.

Design
------
``EphemeralCredentialContext`` is an async context manager. The
caller hands it:

  - a ``SecureTokenStore`` (the source of truth for the
    encrypted ciphertext on disk);
  - a ``ciphertext_path`` (where the encrypted blob lives — the
    canonical path Unifideck owns);
  - a ``cli_filename`` (what the CLI expects, e.g.
    ``user.json``);
  - an ``env_var_name`` mapping the override env var the CLI
    reads (``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` for nile, ``LEGENDARY_CONFIG_DIR``
    for legendary, ``GOGDL_CONFIG_PATH`` for gogdl).

Within the ``async with`` block the caller invokes the CLI with
the returned ``env`` dict. On exit (success OR exception) the
tempdir is unconditionally removed, and on success the (possibly
rotated) plaintext is read back and re-encrypted to the
canonical path.

    Sibling primitive to ``EphemeralCredentialContext`` for CLIs
    whose config directory holds other persistent state besides
    credentials (legendary's ``installed.json`` + ``metadata/``,
    nile's library cache, etc.). Overriding the entire config
    dir to a fresh tempdir would erase that state for the
    duration of the call; instead this primitive only touches
    the single credentials file the CLI authenticates with.

    Lifecycle:

      1. **First-time migration**: if the plaintext file exists
         already (legacy install) and no ciphertext yet, the
         existing plaintext is encrypted into the ciphertext and
         left in place — the CLI keeps working through the
         transition.
      2. **Steady state**: on enter, decrypt ciphertext to the
         plaintext path (mode 0o600 via ``secure_write_atomic``).
         On exit (success), read plaintext back, encrypt to
         ciphertext, remove plaintext from disk. The plaintext
         only exists between enter and exit.
      3. **On exception**: plaintext is wiped from disk
         unconditionally. Ciphertext is NOT touched, preserving
         the last-known-good state.

    Threat model
    ------------
    Same as ``EphemeralCredentialContext`` for the encryption
    properties: defends against accidental exfiltration of the
    file at rest (cloud backups, bug-report archives, syncthing).
    The exposure window during which plaintext exists at the
    canonical path is unavoidable — the CLI needs to read its
    credentials at some point — but the window is tens of
    milliseconds for typical operations and the file is mode
    0o600 throughout.
