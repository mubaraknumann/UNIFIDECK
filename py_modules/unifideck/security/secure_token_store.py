"""core/secure_token_store.py — Encrypted on-disk token storage.
Provides authenticated symmetric encryption for OAuth tokens
persisted by store modules (currently GOG and Microsoft). Built
on cryptography's AESGCM primitive with a key derived via scrypt
from the device's machine-id and a static domain-separation salt.
Threat model addressed
----------------------
This layer protects against ONE specific scenario: accidental
exfiltration of the encrypted token file from the device. A user
who shares a bug report archive, syncs ~/.config to a cloud
backup, or uploads a file to a forum will not leak usable tokens
because the recipient cannot decrypt the file without the
machine-id of the original Steam Deck.
Threat model NOT addressed
--------------------------
This layer does NOT protect against:
- A local attacker with read access to the user's home (they
    can read /etc/machine-id and reconstruct the key)
- A malicious process running under the same uid as Unifideck
- Memory dumps while tokens are in use (plaintext in memory)
- Compromise of the OAuth token at the network level
These are out of scope for a Decky plugin. A real defence-in-
depth solution would require a TPM-backed key, kernel-enforced
process isolation, or a hardware security module — none of which
are accessible from a userspace Python plugin on SteamOS.
Format
------
Encrypted file layout (binary):
        [4 bytes] magic header "UFD1"
        [12 bytes] AES-GCM nonce (random per encryption)
        [N bytes] ciphertext + 16-byte GCM auth tag
Total overhead: 32 bytes per file. The magic header lets us
detect non-encrypted files from a previous Unifideck version
and trigger a one-shot migration without crashing.
KDF parameters
--------------
scrypt(N=2**14, r=8, p=1) — the same parameters as the original
scrypt paper for "interactive" use. ~50 ms on a Steam Deck APU
which is acceptable on the auth path (called once per save) but
slow enough to make brute-forcing impractical.
The salt is a fixed 16-byte constant baked into this module. It
is NOT a secret — its only purpose is domain separation, so that
a key derived for Unifideck cannot be reused on another piece of
software that happens to derive keys from the same machine-id.
